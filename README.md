Project Overview
The IPL Power BI Dashboard is designed to offer an in-depth look into IPL match data.
With an intuitive and interactive interface, users can explore trends, filter information by various dimensions,
(such as teams, players, and seasons), and uncover patterns that can be valuable for cricket enthusiasts, analysts, and sports data researchers.

Data Model
The dashboard is built using a dataset from IPL matches and statistics. The primary tables and fields included are:

Matches: Contains details of individual matches (date, teams, venue, etc.)
Players: Includes player information (names, teams, performance metrics, etc.)
Teams: Data about IPL teams involved in each season
Statistics: Performance metrics for each player and team per match, such as runs, wickets, and strike rates
Please note that there is no "stage" column in the dataset, so analysis by match stage (like league, playoffs, finals) is currently not possible.

Dashboard Features
The dashboard currently offers the following key features:

Overall Team Performance: Compare IPL teams by metrics like wins, losses, runs scored, and wickets.
Top Players Analysis: Identify top performers by runs scored, wickets taken, and other individual metrics.
Seasonal Insights: Track and analyze data over different IPL seasons.
Venue Analysis: View performance trends based on match location and other environmental factors.
